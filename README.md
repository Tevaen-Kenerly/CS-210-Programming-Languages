# CS-210-Programming-Languages
My work with programming languages (most specifically C++). Demonstrating my ability to write well-documented and readable code, design functional programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code. 

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Chada Tech Clock project was designed to solve a time formatting and usability challenge. Displaying time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats simultaneously, with user-controlled time manipulation. This program features a menu-driven interface that allows users to increment hours, minutes, and seconds, while viewing the updated time in both formats. This project demonstrates modular programming, function decomposition, and clean source formatting alighned with industry standards. It also reinforces core programming concepts. The goal was to create a readable, maintainable program that showcases time logic and user interaction in a console-based environment. 

# What did you do particularly well?
For this project one of the things that I did particulary well was my modular code structure and function decomposition. I broke down the program into clear, manageable components such as incrementing hours, minutes, and seconds, which made the logic easy to follow and maintain. I also think I did a good job demonstrating attention to formatting and readability. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There are a few areas that I could enhance my code in, such as the following. Input validation; I could add checks to handle invalid user input and prevent crashed. File and function naming; I could rename some files like main.cpp to reflect their purposes such as renaming main.cpp to main_clock.cpp. Exanded documentation; I could add more comments to explain the logic and improve collaboration further. These changes would all help in making this program more efficient, secure and more!

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was implementing the logic for incrementing time while maintaining proper formatting across both the 12-hour and 24-hour display clocks. Handling edge caes such as, rolling over from 11:59:59 PM to 12:00:00 AM also required careful attention to conditional logic and modular function design. I overcame this challenge by breaking the problem down into smaller functions. After this I tested each independently. I also used flowcharts and pseudocode to visualize the transitions before coding. This helped me isolate bugs and ensure that each time unit updated correclty. Some of the tools and resources I am adding to my support network are sense feedback tool; which is used to validate functional requirements and refine code before submission. I also like to implement more diagrams and object-oriented programming tools such as UML diagrams. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Some of the skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects and course work are the following. Modular programming; I think developing reusable functions for time manipulation and displaying logic is a skill applicable to any strucutured software project. Code readability and documentation; maintaing clean formatting and inline comments is a habit that improves collaboration and maintainability across all coding environments. Problem decomposition; breaking down complex task into manageable components is a foundational skill for debugging, algorithm design, and system arcitecture. Object-oriented programming; I think this skill is valuable to use for the design and organization of a program at any level, breaking down the program into understandalbe steps and diagrams for developing!

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by focusing on modular function design and object-oriented programming. Each operation was seprated into its own function and the code was modeled into a diagram which made it easier to debug, test, and extend. I also used consistent naming conventions, inline comments and documentation, menu driven structure, and scalable time logic. These practices not only improved the project but also laid a foundation for clean, scalable development in future coursework and professional projects!
